Installation

Install the php dbus extension from pecl.
Install skype and create a skype user.
Serve up this directory in your doc root.
Try it.

You may have problems with PHP not being able to connect to the DBUS.  Currenly the only way I have been able to resolve that is by running
the whole app under the in built PHP web server (PHP5.4) to allow access to the current environment. There is likely a workaround that will
enable this to function with apache - however I have not invested the time in working out what it is yet.
